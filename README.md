# Hotels Charlotte - Red Ventures

This project was made as a test for Red Ventures.

## Demo
A GH-Page is available [here](https://thiagonzalez.github.io/hotels-react/).
PS: I'm using the master branch only for deploy. Do not push anything to it.

## Usage
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
3. Access the page through `http://localhost:3000`

## Didn't have time
- Move external fonts to the JS
- Modal with hotel history
- Mobile design for the filter
- Display a message when there is no hotel
